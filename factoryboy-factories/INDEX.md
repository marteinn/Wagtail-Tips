# Using Wagtail with Factory Boy

Wagtail uses treebeard at its base and therefore uses its path struture, by generating the path with a sequence we can in a easy way create test models.

### Example factory

```python
# Tested on Wagtail 1.7 and factory_boy 2.7.1

import factory
from wagtail.wagtailcore.models import Site, Page


class PageFactory(factory.DjangoModelFactory):
    class Meta:
        model = Page

    path = factory.Sequence(lambda x: '00010001{:04d}'.format(x+1))
    depth = 3
    numchild = 0
    live = True

    title = factory.Sequence(lambda x: 'page-title-{0}'.format(x))
```

### Usage

And this is how you might use it in a unittest.

```python
import myapp.factories import PageFactory
page = PageFactory.create(title='mypage')

self.assertEquals(page.title, 'mypage')
```

Keep in mind that this approach put a bit more responsibility on you, since you need to manually both define depth and path (that is otherwise generated by you when you use the built in api).

```python
import myapp.factories import PageFactory
page = PageFactory.create(title='mypage')

sub_page = PageFactory.create(title='mypage', depth=page.depth+1, path='{}0001'.format(page.path))
```
